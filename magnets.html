                The new CMM product project required strong attractive forces to lock/unlock a hirth coupling mechanism in fixed angular 
                positions when scanning.
                <br><br>    
                Using Finite Element Magnetics Modelling (FEMM4.2) with an iteration program run through Lua scripts, the forces 
                between two N42 grade ring magnets with OD of 46mm and ID of 36mm were analyzed at thicknesses of 0 to 10mm.

            An analysis of two ring magnets with a fixed outer diameter of 46mm and a thickness of 3mm was automated using a 
            Lua script to run a iterable internal radius from r=23mm to r=0mm.  
            <br><br>
            The results obtained show that decreasing the inner radius of the ring magnet increases the attractive force 
            up to 16mm (ID32) (EDIT IMAGE XLABEL), where its slowly drops to 95N when it becomes a disk magnet.

            Another invstigation of the effect of magnetic flux containment with a stainless-steel housing 
            around the magnet were undertaken.
            <br><br> 
            This was another considered option for the design of the probe
            because stonger attractive forces could be achieved between the steel encased magnets.
