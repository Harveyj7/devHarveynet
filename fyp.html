            <p > My Final Year project involved the design and prototyping and analysis of an underwater “Nano” glider.
                Current gliders used in oceanography are generally large in scale, often surpassing 50kg in weight. However, for Limnological explorations,
                these large devices are impractical due to their lack of manoeuvrability in smaller environments. For this reason, 
                the downscaling of underwater gliders is increasing in demand for a range of applications.
                <br>  <br>
                The concept selected contains a reservoir connected to a miniature motor- pump. Water is ingested and 
                expelled from the system through the reservoir to vary the system buoyancy. The design was modelled in
                CAD and refined by assessing the forces and moments in an Excel calculations document.
                <br> <br>
                First, the internal buoyancy system was prototyped, with the components 3D printed, laser cut and the
                 reversable motor- pump purchased used. Once successful buoyancy variation was achieved, the external
                  hull and  hydrofoils were prototyped and the whole system assembled. The electronic circuit system 
                  used to control the motor speed and direction was then set up.

            <p class="text">The proof of concept was demostrated in the project as shown in the prototyping clips with an underwater
                glider approximately 100mm in length achieved. However, as the prototyping phase of 
                the project was ceased due to corona virus and university facilities was closed, the development 
                on the glider was been limited and issues with purchased components hindered the development of
                the system. As a result, the project was diverged towards modelling and simulating the system to 
                develop an insight into the performance characteristics of the finished product.
