            <p> Since all the prototyping could not be fully complete due to lack of resources,
                I moved my Final Year Project to a modelling task. The system was modelled on Simulink 
                with all the forces acting on the glider in motion. First, the lift and drag forces on 
                the glider were to be determined from CFX results. The glider oriented at a range of angles 
                was modelled with laminar fluid flow. Using Bernouille's Equation rearranged, the Drag and lift coefficients 
                for each pitch angle could be calculated from the simulation results
                
            </p>
            <div class="formula">
                <img  width=30% src="images/fluideq.png">  
                Using this, the CFD simulation was run for the glider travelling
                at the range of angles expected in its transit (+/-35 deg to the longditudinal axis). The drag coffecient
                was plotted against the pitch as shown.

                These CFD results as well as other required parameters in the Bernouille Eq were then implemented as
                inputs into the Simulink model created to analyse
                the glider in motion. The model was set up with a vertical forces subsystem and a horizontal forces 
                one.

            First, for the vertical forces subsystem, the free body diagram shown was assessed to obtain the governing 
            equation which was expanded as shown given the buoyancy and weight definitions. This was then directly 
            applied as the series of signals into the summation block
            <br><br>
            A rotating model with the moments acting on the glider was also made to assess the glider rotation in pitch.
            <br><br>
            There was a large set of valuable results obtained from the simulink model. Overall the main ones found were that the glider 
            was found to reach a terminal velocity of approximately 0.1m/s at a pitch angle of 35deg at steady state. 
            Varying the motor control would allow the sawtooth profile of the glider to be controlled.
